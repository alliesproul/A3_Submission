Theoretical Task:

1. Asynchronous programming for a weather tracking system is ideal because it will allow other tasks to run while waiting for an external operation. This will reduce CPU usage, improve application responsiveness, and efficiently handle multiple I/O operations. It will be able to handle high volumes of network requests in a web server without blocking execution. If synchronous programming were to be used, each request would have to complete before moving onto the next, thus taking up a lot of CPU time. With asynchronous programming the tasks can be completed concurrently, improving efficiency. There will also be real-time updates since the consumers can be processed and logged in parallel.


2. Asynchronous functions are used in the script to define tasks that execute concurrently without blocking operations. This improves efficiency in data fetching and logging. The function get_weather (an async def function) retrieves weather data asynchronously using aiohttp and “await response.json()” to process the response without blocking the execution. The producer function creates multiple concurrent calls to the function get_weather using asyncio.gather(). This makes sure all city weather is fetched simultaneously. The consumer function continuously reads weather data from the queue and logs it to the file “weather_log.txt”. The consumer function also uses “await queue.get()” so it can wait for new data without blocking the event loop. Overall, async def is used to create asynchronous functions, await suspends function execution while waiting for an asynchronous operation, and asyncio manages the event loop, schedules tasks, and facilitates concurrent execution.
